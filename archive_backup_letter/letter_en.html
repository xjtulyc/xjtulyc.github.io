      I will introduce myself from the following aspects:

      <p class="title">1. Academic Background</p>

      <p>
        I attended Shenzhen Hongling High School for my high
        school education. In my freshman year, I enrolled in
        the
        Experimental Class for Engineering at Xi'an Jiaotong
        University, specializing in electrical engineering.
        In
        my sophomore year, I transferred to the Artificial
        Intelligence Experimental Class at Xi'an Jiaotong
        University. In my junior year, I went to the
        University
        of Manitoba in Canada for an exchange program.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have excelled in my studies. In my freshman year,
        I
        achieved a comprehensive GPA of 91.05, ranking 4th
        out
        of 1138 students and receiving the National
        Scholarship
        as the top student in my college. In my sophomore
        year,
        I achieved a comprehensive GPA of 92.43, ranking 3rd
        out
        of 70 students in my college and receiving the
        Megvii
        Scholarship. I have excellent English proficiency
        with a
        CET-4 score of 603 and a TOEFL score of 89. I have
        participated in various competitions and won the
        Silver
        Award in the International Genetically Engineered
        Machine Competition (iGEM) as the leader of the
        hardware
        and wet lab teams. As a presenter, I participated in
        the
        national-level innovation project "AR Scene
        Navigation
        in Short-Distance Scenarios," which stood out among
        47
        projects in the Telecommunications Department and
        received an excellent evaluation after the final
        defense. I also participated as a presenter in the
        national-level innovation project "Diagnosis and
        Clinical Decision-Making of Adrenal Tumors Based on
        Deep
        Learning," where I was responsible for building
        models
        and other critical tasks. This project also received
        an
        excellent evaluation after the defense. In the first
        two
        years of university, I have established a solid
        foundation in my major. I have taken a total of 7
        math
        courses with a cumulative GPA of 94.6 and achieved
        high
        scores in artificial intelligence-related courses
        with a
        cumulative GPA of 94.6. Some of my course grades
        include: Computational Neural Engineering (99),
        Cognitive Psychology (99), Social Psychology (98),
        Probability, Statistics, and Random Processes (98),
        University Physics II (98), University Physics I
        (97),
        Data Structures and Algorithms (95), Linear Algebra
        Combined with Analytical Solution (94), Calculus I
        (93),
        Computer System Architecture (92), and Calculus II
        (92).
        Through a series of selections, I obtained funding
        from
        the China Scholarship Council (CSC) and became one
        of
        the three students from Xi'an Jiaotong University to
        study abroad at the University of Manitoba in Canada
        during my junior year. My diligent and serious
        attitude
        towards learning has been recognized by my teachers.
        Professor Pengju Ren from Xi'an Jiaotong University
        once
        commented, "Youcheng Li was one of the best students
        of
        mine in the last several years. Based on his solid
        knowledge, he quickly adapted to multiple tasks
        assigned
        to him and had innovative minds on the course."
      </p>

      <p class="title">2. Research Experience</p>

      <p>
        During my middle school years, I set up the life
        ideal of
        medical-industrial crossover and serving the country
        with
        technology. Since my freshman year, I have
        participated in a
        total of eleven domestic and international
        university
        projects, covering a variety of fields such as
        computer
        vision, natural language processing, reinforcement
        learning,
        impulse neural networks and bioinformatics. I have
        explored
        my interest in medical image processing in active
        practice.
        Three representative research experiences are listed
        below.
      </p>
      <p>
        First of all, I joined Prof. Jianru Xue's group at
        Xi'an
        Jiaotong University through the undergraduate "X
        Plan"
        research training program of the School of
        Artificial
        Intelligence from December 2020 to now, and I have
        been
        conducting research training under the guidance of
        Prof.
        Xue. During this period, I have read more than 50
        papers in
        the field of computer vision and gained a
        preliminary
        understanding of the field, and I have also learned
        to use
        common machine learning frameworks, such as PyTorch,
        so that
        my programming skills have been improved. Meanwhile,
        under
        the guidance of Prof. Xue Jianru, I participated in
        the
        national college students' innovation project "AR
        live
        navigation in short-distance scene" as the host,
        responsible
        for image denoising and managing the team, and
        independently
        proposed a moving target removal algorithm based on
        mask-generation model. After the completion of the
        project,
        I carried out research on impulse neural networks
        and
        reinforcement learning under the guidance of Prof.
        Xue
        Jianru.
      </p>
      <p>
        Secondly, from March 2021 to May 2022 I worked on
        pancreatic
        diagnosis based on enhanced CT images under the
        guidance of
        Prof. Cui Wei from the First Affiliated Hospital of
        Xi'an
        Jiaotong University and Prof. Li Chen from the
        School of
        Computer Science and Technology. As the only
        undergraduate
        student in the School of Artificial Intelligence
        within the
        team, I was mainly responsible for the
        implementation of the
        pancreatic cancer detection algorithm and lesion
        segmentation algorithm. During the year-long project
        study,
        I learned the characteristics and preferences of AI
        models
        in the medical field, and studied more than twenty
        relevant
        literatures, which laid a solid theoretical
        foundation for
        the subsequent research. Meanwhile, I mastered the
        ability
        to communicate with members from different
        disciplinary
        backgrounds during the project, which improved my
        teamwork
        ability. After the completion of this project, we
        hope to
        further dig deeper into the value of the dataset and
        algorithm performance, with a view to publishing the
        results
        in high-quality journals.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, I have been working on segmentation
        algorithms for
        spatial transcriptomics data under the guidance of
        Prof.
        Pingzhao Hu at the University of Manitoba, Canada
        from
        December 2021 to present. The weekly group meetings
        have
        greatly improved my oral presentation skills and
        enhanced my
        English language proficiency. Based on the
        theoretical
        accumulation of computer vision and bioinformatics,
        I have
        studied more than ten spatial transcriptomics
        related
        literatures and proposed a weakly supervised spatial
        transcriptome point cloud segmentation algorithm.
      </p>
      <p class="title">3. Future Planning</p>

      <p>

        My main research interest is medical image
        processing. I
        would like to understand the impact of AI
        technologies on
        medical diagnosis and focus on exploring machine
        learning
        frameworks applicable to medical histology data
        represented
        by weak supervision, small samples, and small
        targets. My
        research strength is a solid and comprehensive
        foundation in
        math, cognitive science, neuroscience, and machine
        learning.
        I am able to combine medical knowledge and machine
        learning
        theories to build models with the help of deep
        learning,
        reinforcement learning and other tools to study
        medical
        image processing algorithms and the intrinsic laws
        of
        medical histology data, just as my scientific
        practice in
        deep learning-based cancer diagnosis.
